# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Club

We at AIMLC NUCES KHI wants to promote Articificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies through out the campus for the growth of the society and to build a club where anyone can participate, learn and network with minds having similar goals and objectives. All the resources used in the sessions will be shared here.

There are mainly two ways to learning ML.

- Either take the practical/hands-on approach to learning and start building cool ML applications right away.
- The other path is to slow down and learn how these algorithms actually work. Dig into the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings and come up with different ways to thinking about ML.
 
First one is easier and catchy but shallow. The second one is harder, slower, and frustrating at times but is ultimately more rewarding if you have the appetite for it. Having said that, we don’t recommend blindly getting into the deep theoretical aspects of ML. It gets very daunting very quickly. We are going to take the first approach in the AIMLC Sessions and Workshops along with a flavor of intuitive understanding of the underlying theory. Simply, because it is not feasible to go deep due to time constraints (we are all students too). The aim is to get you to a point where you can go deep and move forward on your own.

Machine Learning has deep roots in Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus and Optimization. A rudimentary idea of these topics is essential to even get started. It is almost impossible to go deep into ML without having a deep understanding of the said topics. We recommend you to build an intuition of these topics. It is a long road and will take time but truly rewarding.

The following resources are meant to be general and we recommend you to try out some of them and pick the path that suites you. Everyone has different way of learning. Not all are made for math and similarly not all have the best time learning to use just the APIs.

*: Recommended by us. But doesn't mean you follow them blindly. Pick the ones that work the best for you.
**: resources that don’t require math background

### A recommendation on how to start AI/ML/DL (Taken from [AIDL](https://web.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/) group):
1. Learn some math/programming
2. Takes at least one course from “Basics of Machine Learning”
3. Find some problem to play with. [Kaggle](kaggle.com) has a ton of them. Iterate task 3 until you get bored.

### Deep Learning:
Pre-Req: Do a coupe of ML courses. Basics of Calculus and Linear Algebra.
1. CS231n – Stanford. Mainly applied to Computer Vision but is a good first DL course *
2. CS224n – Stanford. Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing
3. **Deep Learning A-Z – Udemy
4. **Deep Learning for Coders – Fast.ai
5. Deep Learning – Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio (Book)
6. **Deep Learning with Python – Francois Chollet (Book)

### Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning where algorithms learn by experience rather than data. It is very similar to how we humans/animals learn. We recommend you have done at least the basics of Machine Learning before getting into reinforcement learning. But, note that this class of algorithms is very different and you can get away by starting directly too if you’re very interested. If it gets daunting go back and learn the basics.
1. Reinforcement Learning – Georgia Tech Udacity
2. David Silver’s Course on Reinforcement Learning. (Not recommended for beginners but is probably the best course on reinforcement learning out there.) *
3. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction – Sutton and Barto (Book) *

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):
We would like to redirect you to a great set of FAQs compiled by Arthur Chan on [AIDL](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/permalink/385843868475168/). Any other question that you have in mind and think that it should be added in the FAQs, drop that in the comments and we will be happy to answer it here.

##### How to use the forum:
We welcome you to start discussions, ask questions and share resources you like but we would encourage you to first google the question. Learning to search resources effectively is also a big part of learning on your own.

Note: We are not undermining people who want to learn to build intelligent apps rather than getting into theory/research but we want to press on the fact that everything you will be using have deep theoretical/mathematical underpinnings and knowing them can go a long way in building these systems sensibly. And vice versa, there’s no point knowing all the math and not knowing how to make it work in a practical situation. So both the things a interwoven and there's no escape from any of it at least at an introductory level.
