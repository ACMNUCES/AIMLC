# AIMLC Week 2 (Setup Guide)
Before delving into Machine Learning, we all have to be familiar with **Python 3** and common libraries including **Numpy** and **Pandas**, and also **Jupyter Notebook** that helps playing around with Python snippets, making plots, and collaborating with others.

This guide will help you setting up your personal laptops with the tools, so that you can take whole advantage of the hands-on sessions.

*Note: We will be only using Python 3, so make sure that you have Python 3 installed and not Python 2.*

## Anaconda

Anaconda Distribution is the fastest and easiest way to do Python and R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It has all the required tools.

README: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/

#### Windows

> https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows

* Download *Python 3.7.1 version* (bits version depending on your system).
* Run the downloaded executable with default options.  

#### Ubuntu (Debian-based distros)

> https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux

* Download *Python 3.7.1 version installer* (bits version depending on your system). 
* Execute following commands in the terminal:

> bash DOWNLOAD_FILENAME.sh
> Choose default options in the installer and just press enter on each prompt except "Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda3 install location to PATH"
> Enter "yes" in the above prompt.
